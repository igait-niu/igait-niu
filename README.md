## üî≠ Research Goal
Design and develop a website capable of predicting an ASD index for children living in underserved, underrepresented, and low-income communities, as well as providing users with the resources to evaluate their child for the potential need to seek a professional diagnosis.‚Äã

iGAIT is not meant for diagnosing children's ASD but instead is intended as a platform for users across the world to receive a cost-effective approach to evaluating children for ASD as early as possible. 

## üå± Facts
- 71,469 children in Illinois (1 in 44 children in the entire US) have autism spectrum disorder ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/ss/ss7202a1.htm?s_cid=ss7202a1_w))
- Because of poor healthcare or high costs, children from minority, low-income, and rural backgrounds are often diagnosed at a late age
- Gender, age, and cultural disparities in diagnosis also exist - leaving a large portion of children undiagnosed ([review](https://doi.org/10.31083/j.jin2202051%C2%A0))
- Due to the complex and spectromic nature of ASD, it is difficult to recognize and diagnose
